🐝 Hive - LinkedIn Profile Harvester
Internal Recruitment Tool for HR Consultants

Hive is a Chrome extension designed exclusively for recruitment consultants at our organization. It streamlines candidate sourcing by extracting LinkedIn profile data and automatically creating candidate records in our internal Hive recruitment system.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🏢 WHO THIS IS FOR

This extension is for INTERNAL USE ONLY by authorized recruitment consultants. Users must have valid credentials to access our Hive recruitment system. Not intended for public use.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✨ KEY FEATURES

✅ One-Click Profile Extraction
Navigate to any LinkedIn profile and click "Harvest" to instantly extract all visible information.

✅ Automatic Candidate Creation
Extracted data is sent directly to your Hive recruitment system, creating a fully populated candidate record in seconds.

✅ Contact Info Auto-Detection
Automatically detects and extracts phone numbers and email addresses when the LinkedIn contact info dialog is visible. No manual clicking needed.

✅ Comprehensive Data Capture
• Full name, headline, and location
• Profile photo (high resolution)
• Current position and company
• Complete work experience with dates, roles, descriptions, and locations
• Education history (schools, degrees, years of study)
• Contact information (phone, email when available)
• Profile URL for reference

✅ Smart Dual-Page Support
Works seamlessly on both the main profile page AND the experience details page. Automatically adapts to LinkedIn's different page structures.

✅ Photo Persistence
Profile photos are captured and preserved across page navigation, ensuring consistent candidate records.

✅ Data Review & Edit
Review all extracted data in the extension sidebar before sending to Hive. Edit any fields manually if needed.

✅ Clear & Reset
Pink "Clear" button lets you quickly reset all form data between harvests for efficient batch processing.

✅ Stable & Reliable
Uses stable selectors (aria-labels, data attributes) instead of fragile CSS classes, reducing breakage when LinkedIn updates their UI.
